## Creating the `batch-*.gltf` files

Most of these are generated by the `GfxBatchRendererTest`, running it with
`-XS <path>` will stop on the first failure and save the file. Be sure to check
`git diff` for suspicious changes.

The only exception are `*-compressed.gltf` files, which are generated by hand.
Unfortunately `StbResizeImageConverter` doesn't have nearest-neighbor filtering
and there's no builtin in Magnum either, so the process is done in a rather
painful way by extracting individual 2D slices of the KTX2 file as a PNG,
converting them via ImageMagick, then combining them back, compressing as DXT,
and referencing manually from a copy of the original
`batch-four-squares.gltf` / `batch-square-circle-triangle.gltf` files. The
binary buffer is unchanged, referenced from the original file.

```sh
magnum-imageconverter -I GltfImporter -i experimentalKhrTextureKtx,ignoreRequiredExtensions --image 0 --layer 0 batch-four-squares.{gltf,0.0.png} -D3
magnum-imageconverter -I GltfImporter -i experimentalKhrTextureKtx,ignoreRequiredExtensions --image 0 --layer 1 batch-four-squares.{gltf,0.1.png} -D3
magnum-imageconverter -I GltfImporter -i experimentalKhrTextureKtx,ignoreRequiredExtensions --image 0 batch-square-circle-triangle.{gltf,0.png}

convert batch-four-squares.0.0.png -interpolate Nearest -filter point -resize 400% batch-four-squares.0.0.4x.png
convert batch-four-squares.0.1.png -interpolate Nearest -filter point -resize 400% batch-four-squares.0.1.4x.png
convert batch-square-circle-triangle.0.png -interpolate Nearest -filter point -resize 200% batch-square-circle-triangle.0.2x.png

magnum-imageconverter --array --layers batch-four-squares.0.{0,1}.4x.png batch-four-squares.0.4x.dxt.ktx2 -C StbDxtImageConverter
magnum-imageconverter batch-square-circle-triangle.0.2x.png batch-square-circle-triangle.0.2x.dxt.ktx2 -C StbDxtImageConverter
```

Only the `*.dxt.ktx2` files are useful, the rest can be deleted again after the
process.
